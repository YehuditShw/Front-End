        <p> <strong id="goal"> Goal of the game:</strong><br>
            Blow up all the balls on the game fighter as fast as possible --- !!! <br><br>
            <strong id="howto">how do you play?</strong><br>
            The only option to blow up balls and take them out of the game board <br> <br>
            is to send them a friend of the same color- <br>
            As soon as they meet everyone will explode together ... <br>
            After each ball is sent a new ball of a color unknown in advance .... <br><br>
            pay attention!! <br>
            In 3 minutes you must finish emptying the entire game board-- <br>
            The more balls you explode, the higher your score will be .. !! <br>
            To send the balls, aim with the right and left arrows on the keyboard <br>
            And send them up with the up arrow. <br>
            Pay attention to the timer that appears on the side of the game ... <br>
            <br>
            Be focused, think of moves ... and make sure your explosions get bigger and bigger - <br>
            that way you will score more and more points. <br>
            Did you succeed ?! <br>
            <strong> Excellent !! </strong><br>
            And now, to the next step-- <br>
            We'll see you do it again more quickly ----- <br>
            <strong> Come on ---- Enjoy !!! </strong> <br>
